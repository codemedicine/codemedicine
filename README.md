## Executive Summary

`codemedicine` synthesizes rigorous cellular biology with software engineering and data-science best practices to create an authoritative, practice-oriented knowledge base on cellular organelles. The materials include deep-reading essays, annotated code examples, interactive notebooks, reproducible pipelines, and clinically-minded discussions that bridge molecular detail to systems-level interpretation.

This README is intended for advanced students, computational biologists, biomedical engineers, clinical researchers, and educators who require more than an encyclopedic list — it is a modular, extensible curriculum and toolkit for building reproducible analyses and translational prototypes centered on organelle biology.

---

## Philosophy & Scope

* **Interdisciplinary rigor:** marry experimental cell biology with software engineering, data provenance, and clinical constraints.
* **Reproducibility-first:** every analytical claim is paired with runnable artifacts (notebooks, container images, CI checks) so results can be reproduced deterministically.
* **Mechanisms-to-medicine:** emphasize mechanistic understanding of organelles (structure, biochemistry, dynamics) and map those mechanisms to diagnostic, therapeutic, and analytic use cases.
* **Ethics and privacy by design:** when handling human-derived data, privacy-preserving practices and ethical considerations are explicit and enforced.

Scope includes: organelle-specific reference essays (nucleus, mitochondria, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, peroxisomes, endosomes, chloroplasts for plant content), experimental and computational techniques for imaging and -omics, and engineering assets for building clinical decision support prototypes.

## Comprehensive Content Overview

### Cellular Organelles — Deep Reference

Each organelle entry in the `docs/organelles/` folder contains the following standardized sections:

1. **Structural anatomy** — membranes, subdomains, characteristic ultrastructure (e.g., mitochondrial cristae, Golgi cisternae).
2. **Core biochemical roles** — enzymatic activities, metabolic pathways, ion handling.
3. **Genomic/proteomic identity** — canonical markers, resident proteome, and post-translational modifications with annotated references.
4. **Dynamics & trafficking** — biogenesis, fission/fusion, contact sites, and transport machinery.
5. **Pathophysiology** — diseases and phenotypes arising from dysfunction, with example clinical cases and mechanistic hypotheses.
6. **Assays & readouts** — recommended experimental designs, controls, quantitative readouts, and pitfalls.
7. **Computational models & code** — worked examples (simulations, image analysis pipelines, statistical models).

Examples of included organelle pages:

* Nucleus: chromatin organization, nuclear transport, lamina mechanics, nucleolar function, links to epigenomics pipelines.
* Mitochondria: multi-scale energy modeling, mitophagy, heteroplasmy, and clinical mitochondrial syndromes.
* ER & Golgi: secretory pathway kinetics, glycosylation heterogeneity, ER stress and UPR in disease.
* Lysosomes & autophagy: cargo recognition, lysosomal storage disorders, therapeutic enzyme replacement modeling.

### Mechanistic & Clinical Relevance

For each organelle we provide translational vignettes that connect molecular phenotypes to diagnostics and interventions:

* **Biomarker discovery:** deriving organelle-specific proteomic signatures from fractionation experiments and single-cell -omics.
* **Targeted therapeutics:** organelle-directed delivery strategies (lipid nanoparticles, lysosome-targeting motifs) and modeling of pharmacokinetics at the subcellular scale.
* **Disease modeling:** how organelle dysfunction propagates to tissue-level pathology using agent-based or ODE-based multiscale simulations.

Each vignette includes sample data, reproducible analysis notebooks, and recommended validation experiments.

### Techniques & Workflows

A curated set of technical primers and end-to-end workflows, including:

* **Microscopy stack:** labeling strategies (fluorescent proteins, organelle dyes), image acquisition parameters, deconvolution, and super-resolution considerations.
* **Biochemical isolation:** differential centrifugation, density gradients for organelle purification, mass-spec sample prep notes.
* **Computational pipelines:** image segmentation & quantification, single-cell organelle profiling, spatial transcriptomics co-registration.
* **Statistical & causal methods:** experimental design recommendations (power analysis for organelle phenotypes), causal inference frameworks for mechanistic claims.

Each workflow contains `README.md`, `Dockerfile`, `environment.yml`, and `CI` tests to ensure reproducibility.

## Featured Projects & Examples

This organization aggregates multiple repositories (see top-level repo index). Representative project summaries:

### MedOrgAtlas

A multi-modal atlas combining high-resolution imaging, organelle-enriched proteomics, and single-cell RNA-seq metadata. Includes:

* Standardized metadata model (based on MIAME/FAIR principles)
* Searchable index and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating cross-modal queries
* Reproducible pipelines for segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering

### OrganelleSegNet

An advanced segmentation suite optimized for subcellular compartments. Features:

* Multi-class segmentation architectures (U-Net variants, attention modules)
* Uncertainty estimation, instance segmentation, and co-localization scoring
* Export to ONNX/TensorRT for accelerated inference

### CausalOrgans

A toolkit for causal discovery and sensitivity analysis applied to organelle perturbation screens. Contains:

* DoWhy/EconML integration examples
* Simulation utilities to benchmark identifiability under various perturbation designs

Each project includes a `docs/` section, interactive demos where feasible, and badges for CI, coverage, and reproducibility.

## Learning Paths & Use Cases

This repository is arranged to support multiple learning modalities:

* **Reader:** conceptual essays + glossary + advanced reading lists.
* **Practitioner:** hands-on notebooks, datasets (synthetic/public), and pipeline templates.
* **Researcher:** experimental design templates, reproducible analysis scripts, and benchmarks.
* **Instructor:** slide decks, problem sets, and lab assignments with solution keys.

Use-case examples:

* Rapid prototyping of an image-based organelle classifier and packaging it as a microservice.
* Reproducing published organelle proteomics with supplied raw data and environment specifications.
* Designing a small clinical pilot to probe lysosomal enzyme levels as a biomarker.

## Reproducibility, FAIR Data & Engineering Practices

`codemedicine` enforces strict reproducibility policies across projects:

* **Environments:** `environment.yml` + `Dockerfile` per project; deterministic builds using pinned dependencies.
* **Data versioning:** DVC or DataLad for large binary assets; small worked examples included in `data/`.
* **Experiment tracking:** standardized MLFlow / Weights & Biases templates with example runs in `experiments/`.
* **Continuous integration:** GitHub Actions for tests, linting, and lightweight runnable notebooks.
* **Licensing & provenance:** every dataset and code module is annotated with license and provenance metadata; human-derived data requires data-sharing agreements and IRB-like statements in `docs/ethics.md`.
* **FAIR principles:** metadata-rich datasets, persistent identifiers (DOIs) for curated snapshots, and machine-readable metadata (JSON-LD) where applicable.

Reproducibility checklist (per project):

1. `repro.sh` or `Makefile` to re-run entire pipeline
2. pinned environment and container image
3. example input + expected output (unit tests)
4. CI badge showing passing baseline tests

---

## APIs, Tools & Integration

* **FHIR / SMART on FHIR demos:** reference adapters that expose organelle-derived metrics in a clinical context (read-only examples only; do not connect to PHI without proper governance).
* **Microservice templates:** example FastAPI + Docker stacks to serve models and analytics endpoints (Swagger UI available via `api/` directories).
* **Visualization components:** React components and Plotly dashboards for organelle quantification and QC.
* **Notebook-to-production:** example conversion paths (Papermill, nbconvert) and orchestration with GitHub Actions for scheduled reports.

## Epilogue — a living knowledge base

This organization is intentionally modular: it grows by curated contributions and carefully documented research artifacts. If you want a tailored `README.md` for a specific repo inside this organization (for example, `MedSegExplain`, `EHRFlow`, or `CausalClinical`), tell me the repo name(s) and I will generate repository-specific READMEs with badges, example commands, and tailored reproducibility instructions.
